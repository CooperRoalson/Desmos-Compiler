## Desmos Compiler

### Overview

A compiler that converts code from a custom programming language into equations that can be pasted into the [Desmos graphing calculator](https://desmos.com/calculator).

### To Run

Compile (if necessary) using CMake. Currently the executable just compiles the code in `test.des` into a file `test.out`, as well as printing the result to the terminal. Eventually you will be able to run it as a terminal command with a filename as an argument.

### Desmos Language Documentation

There isn't any documentation yet, but you can see the general WIP concepts of the language in `languageDemo.des`.
